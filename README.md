Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
Overview
This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
Historical stock market data is used to train the model, enabling it to predict the Adjusted Close prices of a given stock. 
The project is implemented and executed within a Jupyter Notebook.

Project Structure
Data Collection: Historical stock data is fetched using the yfinance library.
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and processed, including feature extraction and scaling.
Model Building: An LSTM model is built using the TensorFlow/Keras library to predict future stock prices.
Model Training: The model is trained on historical data, learning from past price trends.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to compare predicted prices with actual values.


How to Run:-
1)Install the required dependencies.
2)Run the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) to train the model and visualize the results.
